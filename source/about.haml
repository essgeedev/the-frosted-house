      %p There’s a special feeling you get when you are completely welcomed into someone’s home. It comes from the special attention to your needs, the details …nothing is overlooked.  The Frosted House offers an experience like no other. With a Fine Arts degree from The University of Michigan, Jennifer Gonzalez has worn many creative hats over the years.  From Museum Education to Web Design, nothing fulfills her creative passion, and her passion for people, like sugar art. Drawing on her years of design/color training and her years of practice as a sugar artist, Jennifer will create a special centerpiece that will transform your big day into an event to remember. Her attention to detail and friendly manner are what have made her such a success.
